# 1. Executive Summary

## 1.1 Product Vision
Build a production-grade, browser-based DCTL (DaVinci Color Transform Language) file generator that enables colorists, technical directors, and plugin developers to create syntactically correct and optimized DCTL files through a comprehensive GUI, eliminating manual coding requirements while maintaining full access to advanced DCTL features.

## 1.2 Technical Goals
- **Zero-backend architecture**: 100% client-side execution for IP protection and offline capability
- **Type-safe code generation**: Compile-time guarantees for DCTL syntax correctness
- **Performance optimization**: Sub-100ms code generation for files up to 10MB
- **Accessibility compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA with full keyboard navigation
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline-first with service worker caching
