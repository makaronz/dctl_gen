- DCTL syntax highlighting and autocomplete
- Macro library browser with search and categorization
- Code folding and bracket matching
- Integrated validation with inline error markers
- Snippet support for common DCTL patterns

### 4.6: Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation
**Goal:** Implement comprehensive accessibility features and keyboard controls
**Requirements:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components
- Complete keyboard navigation with logical tab order
- ARIA patterns for application structure and live regions
- Screen reader compatibility with descriptive labels
- High contrast mode support with theme variants
- Focus management for modal dialogs and complex interactions

## Technical Requirements

**From Architecture [Source: 3-user-interface-specifications.md#311-responsive-grid-system]:**
```scss
.app-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  gap: var(--spacing-4);
  
  @media (min-width: 1440px) {
    .config-panel { grid-column: span 5; }
    .preview-panel { grid-column: span 7; }
  }
  
  @media (max-width: 1439px) {
    .config-panel, .preview-panel { grid-column: span 12; }
  }
}
```

**From Architecture [Source: 3-user-interface-specifications.md#312-component-hierarchy]:**
```
App
├── Header (ProjectTitle, VersionSelector, ActionBar)
├── MainLayout
│   ├── ConfigPanel (ParameterSection, LutSection, MacroSection, AdvancedSection)
│   └── PreviewPanel (CodePreview, ErrorOverlay, MiniMap)
└── StatusBar (ValidationStatus, PerformanceMetrics, ExportOptions)
```

**From Architecture [Source: 3-user-interface-specifications.md#322-real-time-feedback]:**
- Live code generation (<16ms update cycle)
- Incremental validation (validate only changed portions)
- Error highlighting with line numbers and fix suggestions
- Performance indicators (estimated GPU cycles)

**From Architecture [Source: 3-user-interface-specifications.md#331-aria-patterns]:**
```html
<div role="application" aria-label="DCTL Generator">
  <main role="main" aria-label="Configuration and Preview">
    <section role="region" aria-label="Parameters" aria-live="polite">
      <!-- Proper ARIA structure -->
    </section>
  </main>
</div>
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Epic-Level ACs:
1. **AC1:** Responsive layout works seamlessly on desktop and tablet (1440px+ and below)
2. **AC2:** Real-time code preview updates within 16ms of parameter changes
3. **AC3:** All interactive elements accessible via keyboard navigation
4. **AC4:** Project management allows save/load/export with proper file handling
5. **AC5:** Status bar provides clear feedback on validation and performance
6. **AC6:** Monaco Editor integration supports DCTL syntax and validation
7. **AC7:** Application meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

### Performance Requirements:
- UI updates complete in <16ms for 60fps smooth interaction
- Code generation and preview update in <100ms for typical projects
- Panel resizing maintains 60fps animation performance
- Application loads in <3 seconds on modern browsers
- Memory usage remains under 150MB for typical use

### Accessibility Requirements:
- Complete keyboard navigation with logical tab order
- Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels
- High contrast mode support with 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio
- Focus indicators clearly visible for all interactive elements
- No accessibility violations in automated testing (axe-core)

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Epic 1: Core Engine (requires code generation for preview system)
- Epic 2: Parameter System (requires parameter controls for ConfigPanel)
- Epic 3: LUT Processing (requires LUT upload components)

**Provides Foundation For:**
- Epic 5: Data Management (requires UI components for project management)

**Integration Points:**
- Parameter System UI controls in ConfigPanel
- Core Engine code generation for real-time preview
- LUT Processing components for file upload interface
- Validation Framework for error display and status updates

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Performance degradation with complex UI updates
**Mitigation:** React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback optimization strategies

**Secondary Risk:** Accessibility compliance complexity
**Mitigation:** Use proven shadcn/ui components with built-in accessibility

**Tertiary Risk:** Cross-browser compatibility issues
**Mitigation:** Modern browser targeting (Chrome 90+, Firefox 90+, Safari 14+)
